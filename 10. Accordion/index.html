                    <p>Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.
                        CSS is used to style web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts.
                        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, which allows content to be presented in different ways, for different devices,
                        and for different users.</p>

                        It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>

                    <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, and general-purpose programming language.
                        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.
                        Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional, and procedural styles.</p>
